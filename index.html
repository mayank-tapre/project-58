      <p>In the beautiful town of Modern City somewhere in India, there is a haunted palace named, Vibhooti Mansion. What's not known to the people is that there is a nine year human kid named Pinaki who lives among the ghosts. As a baby, Pinaki was found on the doorstep of the mansion, along with a note that the boy must be protected by the people who live in it.

    The family of ghosts, Col. Suri is the head of the family with his lovely wife, Bubbly Suri, who loves to cook some odd dishes, Happy as a Big Brother to Pinaki and Gappu as a cute-little-talking-dog. The ghost family adopt Pinaki and raise him as one of their own. Time flies, all these years Pinaki has been kept within the safe boundaries of the mansion until one day things take a turn when the protagonist decides to step out to see the outside world and pursue further education in Modern City's famous public school. The family has no choice but to come out of the haunted house for the first time in a decade. Thus begins the spooky adventures of Pinaki and his Ghost family followed by a series of fun and slapstick comedy as they try to fit in the outside world. Interestingly, Pinaki ends up resolving all their conflicts with the humans and balancing all the time keeping his family's hidden identity intact.</p>
